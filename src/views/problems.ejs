      <h1>Identifying the Problems</h1>
      <p>We are listing the problems to clearly understand the challenges faced by learners and the school environment. By mapping out these issues, we can identify their root causes, show how they affect education and well-being, and create targeted solutions that will effectively “break the cycle” of cyber addiction and underperformance.</p>

        <h2>Cyber Addiction</h2>
        <p>The compulsive overuse of digital devices (social media, gaming, streaming) that leads to loss of focus, poor sleep, and declining academic performance. It’s the “driver problem” fueling many of the other issues.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
        <p>Copying or presenting someone else’s work as your own, often because of time pressure, distraction, or lack of digital discipline. Example: 58% of students admit to plagiarism in tests and assignments.</p>

      <article>
        <h2>Academic Underperformance</h2>
        <p>Falling grades and low test scores caused by excessive screen time, poor study habits, and reliance on shortcuts like plagiarism. At Hoërskool Jan Viljoen, teachers report many learners arriving tired from being online late at night, leading to weak results.</p>
